# Events

### List of events:

#### paint

Fired every time the game renders a frame while being connected to a server. Can be used to draw to the screen using the renderer.* functions


{% page-ref page="/developers/globals/renderer" %}


#### run_command

Fired every time the game runs a command (usually 64 times a second, equal to tickrate) while you're alive. This is the best event for processing data that only changes when the game receives an update from the server, like information about other players.

Key | Description
--- | -----------
 **chokedcommands** | Amount of commands that the client has choked
 **command_number** | Current command number



#### setup_command

Fired every time the game prepares a move command that's sent to the server. This is ran before cheat features like antiaim and can be used to modify user input (view angles, pressed keys, movement) how it's seen by the cheat. For example, setting `in_use = 1` will disable antiaim the same way pressing use key ingame does. This is the preferred method of setting user input and should be used instead of `client.exec` whenever possible

 **command_number** | Current command number
 **pitch** | Pitch view angle
